  philosophyP1:
      'Spanish is a language that seems transparent because it is read as it is written, but it quickly traps you in a labyrinth of verb tenses and emotional nuances. But in reality, it is like a puzzle: if you place the pieces in the right order, the result is clear, functional, and even beautiful.',
  philosophyP2Highlight: '💡 The Mengel Method® was created so that order exists from day one.',
  philosophyP3: "A step-by-step, structured, and visual system that guides you with logic, gives you confidence, and allows you to speak from the very first class with real and useful phrases, even if you don't master the grammar yet. It prepares you with security.",
  orderedSpanish: 'Spanish organized, you too.',
