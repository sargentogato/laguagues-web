  philosophyP1:
    'English is a language that seems easy, but confuses because what is written rarely matches what is spoken. But in reality, it is like a puzzle: if you place the pieces in the right order, the result is clear, functional, and even beautiful.',
  philosophyP2Highlight: '💡 The Mengel Method® was created so that order exists from day one.',
  philosophyP3:
    "A step-by-step, structured, and visual system that guides you with logic, gives you confidence, and allows you to speak from the very first class with real and useful phrases, even if you don't master the grammar yet. It prepares you with security.",
